## Problem solving
To solve this issue, we established three core concepts (entities): Coupons, Users, and Products.
A User can have multiple Coupons, but a Coupon can only belong to one User. This is a many-to-one relationship.
The characteristics (attributes) of these entities are simple.
We've implemented eight different access points (endpoints) to interact with this system:

1. For registering new users.
2. To create new coupons.
3. To modify existing coupons.
4. To remove coupons that have not been used.
5. To check if a coupon is valid.
6. To use (redeem) a coupon.
7. To view a history of all coupons used by a specific user.
8. To display a list of all products.
